# ECE299 worklog

The goal is to integrate the [IPC (Incremental Potential Contact)](https://ipc-sim.github.io/) model with existing [PBD (Position Based Dynamics)](https://github.com/ucsdarclab/ARCParticleSim) model for simulation of basic surgical task (grabbing etc).

## Fall 2022

Studied relevant papers given by Fei. Started studying the paper on IPC and PBD along with going through and playing around with the existing scripts. I was completely new to using C++ and working on designing the simulation for the first this process took most of the time.

## Spring 2023

Integrated a brute force algorithm of IPC in along the PBD script as shown below:
